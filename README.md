# CheatSheet-Pentester

this cheatsheet still in progress, the only reason i shared maybe there is someone have a need for this kind of informations

Note: A new version for this cheatsheet is in progress and it will include:
- Declare and descibe some attack that still not complete
- More about Red Team activity Pentesting (SQL evasion technique, AD attack with new techniques...)
- Mobile network attack [Map v2 attack, Diameter attack,SS7 attack and technique (Tracking, interception, DOS, Forwarding, manupulating, etc...)]



This cheatsheet encompasses  all the commands i used during my Training with Cybrary, TryHackMe, eLearnSecurity, Internet research, ICSI,EC-Council, Offensive security .

I really recommended to always check the last version.
